# IOT_BASED_LIVESTOCK_HEALTH_MONITORING_SYSTEM

# Overview
The Livestock Health Monitoring System is a real-time, intelligent solution designed to improve the health, welfare, and productivity of livestock. By integrating IoT sensors, cloud analytics, and predictive algorithms, this system enables early detection and intervention for health issues in cattle and other farm animals.

# Key Features
Wearable IoT Sensors
Monitors vital signs like heart rate, body temperature, and location.

# Gateway Device
Collects sensor data and transmits it securely to the cloud.

# Cloud-Based Machine Learning
Detects health anomalies and predicts illnesses before symptoms appear.

# Mobile & Web Dashboard
Sends real-time alerts and actionable insights to farmers.

# Scalable Architecture
Built using affordable hardware (e.g., Raspberry Pi), enabling deployment in various farm sizes.

# Objectives
Eliminate delays in diagnosing livestock health issues

Reduce veterinary costs through early interventions

Optimize resource usage and improve overall animal welfare

Provide a low-cost, scalable solution accessible to farmers

# How It Works
Wearable sensors are placed on livestock to monitor health metrics.

Data is transmitted via a local gateway (e.g., Raspberry Pi) to a cloud service.

Machine learning models analyze this data in real time.

If anomalies are detected, alerts are sent to a farmer's phone or computer.

The dashboard provides health summaries, trends, and early warnings.
